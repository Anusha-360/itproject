        The food of Tamil Nadu is rich in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food.
        The diet mainly consists of rice, lentils, legumes with spices such as curry leaves, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, garlic etc.
        Coconut is widely used in various forms.
        People of Tamil Nadu believe that serving food to another living being, be it humans or animals, is a service to God himself.
        Therefore, they are incredibly generous when it comes to food, whether it is in their homes or temples or even restaurants.
        Traditionally, this south Indian cuisine is served on a banana leaf, and people sit on the floor to eat. A typical meal consists of Rice, Sambhar(Curry), two types of vegetables, curd and a pickle.

    <p>
        <img src="Kerala_food.jpg" aling="right" width="350"><br />
        Kerala, unlike its neighbours Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, takes pride in its wide variety of non-vegetarian food.
        They've got chicken, mutton, beef, pork and a thrilling variety of seafood - mussels, crab, tiger prawns, king prawns, tiny prawns, oysters, sardines, mackerel, tuna and gorgeous red lobsters.
        This 'land of spices' has many exquisite foods to showcase but there few ingredients that I found common to most foods - coconut, chopped, grated or shaved, coconut milk or paste used in gravies or as oil for cooking.
        Chillis, curry leaf, mustard seeds and tamarind also dominate the dishes.
